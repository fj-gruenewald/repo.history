# store-simulation
This is a department store simulation written in C#. It offers the possibility to run a day or a whole week.

There is a 75% chance that every hour a customer will come, 25% chance it is a customer who has already been there. Every customer buys 3 random items in any number between 1-3

When you clone the repository you get the last version that was worked on which is a complete week simulation where everything that happens in the console is stored in text files in the exe folder
