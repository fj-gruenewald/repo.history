### [csharp-object-detection-alturos](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/repo.history/tree/main/WinForms%20Applications/csharp-object-detection-alturos)
An application for object detection using alturos in c#, a small weekend project to see how it actually works. <br/>
Alturos has CPU and GPU support and supports real-time object detection based on yolo(You Only Look Once) and a <br/>
multi object detection algorithm which uses convolutional neural network to detect and identify objects.
<br/>


### [csharp-steganography](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/repo.history/tree/main/WinForms%20Applications/csharp-steganography)
A simple steganography application written in C# Winform .Net Framework that allows to hide messages in images and retrieve them later. <br/>
The algorithm is easy to recognize if you know that it is a steganography image.
<br/>


### [csharp-vpntester](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/repo.history/tree/main/WinForms%20Applications/csharp-vpntester)
Is my VPN really working? <br/>
I asked myself the same question and built a simple VPN tester based on ipapi that gives me information about my connection status and displays it in a simple winform.

The whole thing works with a Windows form in C# .Net Framework.
